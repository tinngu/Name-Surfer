The web application is run through NameSurfer.rb

It uses the pre-created Names.db made by createDB.rb

The name database is created through createDB.rb, which is run
separately from the actual NameSurfer application.

Do be aware that the names-data.txt file is VERY VERY long
so it takes quite a bit of time for the database to be created
through createDB.rb.

If you want to create the name database you can do so, however
if you attempt to read or access the database while it is being 
created it will halt and open up with the names and numbers that
were created.

The database however is ready to GO and completed for usage with the applicaion.
